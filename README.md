# Array-Sorting
A Python Program, that sorts an array's index or elements in a preferred order

I mainly based this off my teacher's activity in progcon. I think I messed up option [4] since it was asking for the number of ELEMENTS that repeated. but not the total number itself.

I'm also not confident on what she wanted to happen in every option since she didn't clarify the activity enough, but I think I got the "jist" of it. College life ig
